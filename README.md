Observations:

1) There is a noticeable rise in the max temperature as the latitude increases toward zero (where the equator is) and a definite decrease as the latitude increases (toward the North Pole)

2) The cloudiness % distribution pattern appears similar across latitudes, although it seems more often than not that it is either very cloudy or not cloudy at all

3) The wind speed increases the farther one moves from the equator, especially from latitudes -20 and downwards, or 60 and upwards
